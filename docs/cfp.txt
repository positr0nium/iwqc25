Cfp: International Workshop on Quantum Compilation -- 6-7 September 2025

Call for Papers
7th International Workshop on Quantum Compilation
6-7 September 2025, Helsinki, Finland 
https://quantum-compilers.github.io/iwqc25/

We invite contributions to the 7th International Workshop on Quantum Compilation, which will take place at Aalto University in Helsinki, on the 6th and 7th of September 2025.

Submission of abstracts : 13 July 2025 (anywhere-on-earth)
Notification of decisions : 27 July 2025
Registration deadline : 31 August 2025
Workshop : 6 and 7 September 2025

The workshop aims to bring together researchers from quantum computing, electronic design automation, and compiler construction. Open questions that we anticipate this group to tackle include new methods for circuit synthesis, optimization, and rewriting, techniques for verifying the correctness of quantum programs, and new techniques for compiling efficient circuits and protocols regarding fault-tolerant and architecture constraints.

The main purpose of the workshop is to exchange recent ideas and research in the area of quantum compilation.  Topics of interest for the workshop include:

* Optimizing compilers for quantum software
* Quantum and reversible circuit peep-holing and (re)synthesis
* Reversible logic synthesis
* Technology-aware mapping
* Fault-tolerant circuit compilation
* Intermediate representations for quantum software
* Quantum programming languages
* Design-space exploration for automatic code generation from classical HDL specification
* Optimized libraries (e.g., for arithmetic and Hamiltonian simulation)
* Benchmarking of circuits for small and medium scale quantum computers
* Software and tools for all above mentioned topics
* Quantum outreach: coding contests, tutorials, education

The workshop has no formal proceedings. Authors are invited to submit an abstract or a paper, with no restrictions on the format. However please use your common sense : the referees need to be able to assess the submission, so you need to describe the work in enough detail to allow this.  Submission of tool and case-study papers are highly encouraged. In case of a positive evaluation, submissions are accepted either as oral or poster presentation to be part of the workshop program. All abstracts and papers are distributed only among the participants, but can be shared on the workshop's website with the author's consent.

Accepted submissions should be presented in person in Helsinki — please note the workshop dates! Submissions must point out who will present the contribution if it is selected.

Submission is via EasyChair. Please submit your contribution here:
