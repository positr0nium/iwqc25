    Routing-Aware Placement for Zoned Neutral Atom Quantum
Computers
  </span></br>
  <div class="abstract">
    <b>Abstract:</b>
    Quantum computing promises to solve previously intractable
problems, with neutral atoms emerging as a promising
technology. Zoned neutral atom architectures enable immense
parallelism and higher coherence times by shielding idling
atoms from laser interference. However, effective quantum
computation also requires advanced software, particularly
compilers that optimize algorithm execution for the
hardware. In this context, the interplay between placement
and routing is crucial, as sub-optimal placements can cause
unnecessary serialization of atom rearrangements. Existing
compilers treat placement and routing independently,
focusing only on travel distances. This work presents
routing-aware placement, which proactively considers
routing constraints to minimize both rearrangement steps
and travel distances. Leveraging the A* algorithm, our
approach reduces rearrangement time by 17% on average and
up to 49% compared to the state-of-the-art. The complete
code is available open-source as part of the Munich Quantum
Toolkit (MQT) at <a href="https://github.com/cda-tum/mqt-qmap">https://github.com/cda-tum/mqt-qmap</a>.

    Ancilla-free Quantum Adder with Sublinear Depth
  </span></br>
  <div class="abstract">
    <b>Abstract:</b>
    We present the first exact quantum adder with sublinear
depth and no ancilla qubits. Our construction is based on
classical reversible logic only and employs low-depth
implementations for the CNOT ladder operator and the
Toffoli ladder operator, two key components to perform
    ripple-carry addition.
Namely, we demonstrate that any ladder of n CNOT gates can
be replaced by a CNOT-circuit with O (log n) depth, while
maintaining a linear number of gates.We then generalize
this construction to Toffoli gates and demonstrate that any
ladder of n Toffoli gates can be substituted with a circuit
with O(log2 n) depth while utilizing a linearithmic number
of gates. This builds on the recent works of Nie et al.
and Khattar and Gidney on the technique of
conditionally clean ancillae. By combining these two key
elements, we present a novel approach to design quantum
adders that can perform the addition of two n-bit numbers
in depth O(log2 n) without the use of any ancilla and using
classical reversible logic only (Toffoli, CNOT and X gates).

    Tour de gross: A modular quantum computer based on
bivariate bicycle codes
  </span></br>
  <div class="abstract">
    <b>Abstract:</b>
    We present the bicycle architecture, a modular quantum
computing framework based on high-rate, low-overhead
quantum LDPC codes identified in prior work. For two
specific bivariate bicycle codes with distances 12 and 18,
we construct explicit fault-tolerant logical instruction
sets and estimate the logical error rate of each
instruction under circuit noise. We develop a compilation
strategy adapted to the constraints of the bicycle
architecture, enabling large-scale universal quantum
circuit execution. Integrating these components, we perform
end-to-end resource estimates demonstrating that an order
of magnitude larger logical circuits can be implemented
with a given number of physical qubits on a bicycle
architecture than on surface code architectures. We
anticipate further improvements through advances in code
constructions, circuit designs, and compilation techniques.

    Multi-product commutation relation for transpiling
Clifford+T circuits
  </span></br>
  <div class="abstract">
    <b>Abstract:</b>
    Quantum compilers that reduce the number of T-gates are
essential for minimizing the overhead of fault-tolerant
quantum computation. To achieve effective T-gate reduction,
it is necessary to identify equivalent circuit
transformation rules that are not yet utilized in existing
tools. In this study, we investigate the rotation axes of
multi-Pauli rotation gates and introduce a nontrivial
equivalent transformation rule, the multi-product
commutation relation (MCR). This rule constructs gate
sequences based on specific commutation properties among
multi-Pauli operators, yielding seemingly non-commutative
instances that can actually be commuted. To evaluate
whether existing compilers account for this commutation
rule, we create a benchmark circuit dataset using a quantum
circuit unoptimization. This technique intentionally adds
redundancy to the circuit while keeping its equivalence. By
leveraging the known structure of the original circuit
before unoptimization, this method enables a quantitative
evaluation of compiler performance by measuring how closely
the optimized circuit matches the original circuit. Our
numerical experiments reveal that the transformation rule
based on MCR is not yet incorporated into current
compilers. This finding suggests an untapped potential for
further T-gate reduction by integrating MCR-aware
transformations, paving the way for improvements in quantum
compilers.

    Data-Flow Analysis of Stabilizers for Quantum Programs
  </span></br>
  <div class="abstract">
    <b>Abstract:</b>
    Commuting gates or blocks of gates imply there are multiple
places across a quantum circuit where the application of a
particular gate would have the same effect. This is central
to circuit optimisation passes that merge similar rotation
gates (a.k.a. phase folding), or restructure the circuit
into regions that are more amenable to resynthesis methods
(such as collecting large regions of commuting rotations
for synthesis by mutual diagonalisation or for the purpose
of T-gate optimisation). Even more opportunities for these
optimisations occur if we can safely move gates between
control-flow blocks in a quantum program.
    <br><br>
Recent work by Amy and Lunderville rephrased the analysis
for phase folding as a relational data-flow analysis,
making it easier to reuse existing infrastructure from
classical tools or integrate with other techniques for
compiling classical programs. We propose a way to modify
this method to track stabilizers as relations which are
asymptotically efficient to work with and admit simple
proofs of (relative) completeness for phase folding.
Additionally, the new data-flow values completely capture
the semantics of a basic block which can be resynthesised
directly, where some of the stabilizers identified by the
analysis present more degrees of freedom for optimisation
during resynthesis.

    T Gate Hoisting in Dynamic Circuits
  </span></br>
  <div class="abstract">
    <b>Abstract:</b>
    Dynamic quantum circuits allow mid-circuit measurements
whose outcomes influence the subsequent circuit execution
via classical control-flow. We propose a compiler pass that
reduces the T-count of such dynamic circuits by detecting
opportunities for linear phase polynomials to be hoisted
out of control-flow structures. For example, in some
situtions, T gates may be moved out of loops and replaced
with a classical phase accumulator.
    <br><br>
Our pass works across arbitrary structured and nested
control-flow and scales to arbitrary branching depths.
Apart from the hoisting itself, it fully maintains the
program structure and performs no code duplication or
unrolling. We framing the problem of detecting hoisting
opportunities in terms of a phase folding analysis and
build on top of the PF domain recently proposed by Amy and
Lunderville for folding phases via data-flow analysis. We
provide a prototype implementation, and a production grade
implementation in the tket compiler is underway.

    Recursive Cartan decompositions for unitary synthesis
  </span></br>
  <div class="abstract">
    <b>Abstract:</b>
    Recursive Cartan decompositions (CDs) provide a way to
exactly factorize quantum circuits into smaller components,
making them a central tool for unitary synthesis. Here we
present a detailed overview of recursive CDs, elucidating
their mathematical structure, demonstrating their
algorithmic utility, and implementing them numerically at
large scales. We adapt, extend, and unify existing
mathematical frameworks for recursive CDs, allowing us to
gain new insights and streamline the construction of new
circuit decompositions. Based on this, we show that several
leading synthesis techniques from the literature—the
Quantum Shannon, Block-ZXZ, and Khaneja-Glaser
decompositions—implement the same recursive CD. We also
present new recursive CDs based on the orthogonal and
symplectic groups, and derive parameter-optimal
decompositions. Furthermore, we aggregate numerical tools
for CDs from the literature, put them into a common
context, and complete them to allow for numerical
implementations of all possible classical CDs in canonical
form. As an application, we efficiently compile
fast-forwardable Hamiltonian time evolution to fixed-depth
circuits, compiling the transverse-field XY model on a
thousand qubits into 2 million gates in 22 seconds on a
laptop.

    Approximate simulation of quantum circuits via
mixed-channel phase squashing
  </span></br>
  <div class="abstract">
    <b>Abstract:</b>
    In the era of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ)
devices, there is a constant need to optimize the gate
count, circuit depth, and in general, execution time. In
this work, we introduce mixed-channel phase squashing, a
novel protocol for approximate quantum circuit simulation
that extends prior techniques by allowing mixed quantum
channels. Our protocol uses the ZX-calculus optimization
techniques and a greedy strategy that selectively replaces
small-angle Z-phase gates with stochastic mixtures of
identity and different Z-phase gates, all under a strict
error budget. We demonstrate that, while the approach
yields modest two-qubit gate-count reduction in generic
random quantum circuits, it achieves substantial reduction
in structured circuits, such as the quantum Fourier
transform. These results highlight the potential of
mixed-channel approximations to enhance near-term quantum
circuit performance, suggesting new directions for
resource-aware quantum compilation beyond pure unitary
channels.

    Optimal number of parametrized rotations and Hadamard gates
in parametrized Clifford circuits with non-repeated
parameters
  </span></br>
  <div class="abstract">
    <b>Abstract:</b>
    We present an efficient algorithm to reduce the number of
non-Clifford gates in quantum circuits and the number of
parametrized rotations in parametrized quantum circuits.
The method consists in finding rotations that can be merged
into a single rotation gate. This approach has already been
considered before and is used as a pre-processing procedure
in many optimization algorithms, notably for optimizing the
number of Hadamard gates or the number of T gates in
Clifford+T circuits. Our algorithm has a better complexity
than similar methods and is particularly efficient for
circuits with a low number of internal Hadamard gates.
Furthermore, we show that this approach is optimal for
parametrized circuits composed of Clifford gates and
parametrized rotations with non-repeated parameters. For
the same type of parametrized quantum circuits, we also
prove that a previous procedure optimizing the number of
Hadamard gates and internal Hadamard gates is optimal. This
procedure is notably used in our low-complexity algorithm
for optimally reducing the number of parametrized rotations.

    ucc-ft: Formal Verification for the Fault-Tolerant Compiler
Stack
  </span></br>
  <div class="abstract">
    <b>Abstract:</b>
    A critical property of any quantum error correcting code
implementation is fault-tolerance (FT): the physical
circuits that perform encoding, decoding, and logical
operations must not introduce or propagate errors in a way
that overwhelms the code's corrective capabilities.
Verifying this property is notoriously difficult and
error-prone to perform manually, especially for complex
codes and compiled circuits. By incorporating the
techniques of quantum symbolic execution, Chen et. al
developed an automatic verification framework and tool for
checking quantum fault-tolerance. The approach leverages
symbolic execution and Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT)
solvers to automatically prove whether a given circuit
gadget is fault-tolerant for a specific QECC. We build on
this foundation and introduce ucc-ft, an open-source tool
that brings this verification technique into a practical,
compiler-friendly ecosystem. It supports standard
interfaces such as Python and OpenQASM 3, making advanced
fault-tolerance verification accessible to both quantum
researchers and compiler developers. In this submission, we
provide an overview of the formal verification method,
describe the architecture of ucc-ft, and demonstrate its
utility in verifying an example circuit.

    Unitary Compiler Collection: A Community-Driven,
Interoperable, Open-Source Quantum Compiler
  </span></br>
  <div class="abstract">
    <b>Abstract:</b>
    We introduce Unitary Compiler Collection (UCC), an
open-source Python package for front-end-agnostic,
high-performance compilation of quantum circuits. UCC's
goal is to gather the best of open-source compilation to
make quantum programming simpler, faster, and more
scalable. As quantum hardware advances, so does the
complexity of programming it: increasing qubit counts,
diverse gate operations, and varied architectures all
present new challenges for quantum compilation. Two major
challenges that we see are (1) compiler improvements are
often isolated in separate libraries or unmaintained
repositories without integration into existing tools, and
(2) there are high switching costs between quantum
computing frameworks and hardware platforms for both
compiler developers and users. To address these, Unitary
Foundation has developed UCC with an architecture and
contribution framework to foster collaboration and enable
the most performant tools of quantum and classical
compilation to work together.

    Graphix: An Open-Source Compiler and Simulator for
Measurement-Based Quantum Computation
  </span></br>
  <div class="abstract">
    <b>Abstract:</b>
    This contribution presents Graphix, an open-source software
library written in Python for measurement-quantum
computation (MBQC).
    <br><br>
MBQC is an important computational model that has not been
as thoroughly investigated as the circuit model which
provides complementary insights and new handles on
algorithm design. In this model, a quantum computation (a
pattern) is executed by starting from an initial resource
state and applying adaptive single-qubit measurements where
adaptivity and Pauli corrections are required to compensate
the randomness of quantum measurements.
    <br><br>
The Graphix library contains tools to transpile from
quantum circuits, analyse graphical properties known as
flow conditions, transpile to and from ZX diagrams,
manipulate the patterns (standardisation, Pauli
measurements presimulation) and to simulate patterns on our
internal backends (statevector, density matrix and tensor
network). Moreover, an expressive noise model interface has
been implemented for the density matrix backend allowing
the design of custom MBQC-native noise models.
    <br><br>
The talk will highlight the theoretical foundations of the
software, its core features as well as the general
direction for future developments. Emphasis will be put on
the transpilation between the different languages related
to MBQC (circuits, patterns, open graphs and ZX diagrams)
and the ongoing efforts to develop applications
(variational algorithms, verification of quantum
computation) and to interface the library with QPU
providers' SDKs and hardware.

    Decomposition of multi-qutrit gates generated by
Weyl-Heisenberg strings
  </span></br>
  <div class="abstract">
    <b>Abstract:</b>
    Decomposing unitary operations into native gates is an
essential step for implementing quantum algorithms. For
qubit-based devices, where native gates are typically
single- and two-qubit operations, a range of decomposition
techniques have been developed. In particular, efficient
algorithms exist for decomposing exponentials of Pauli
strings while taking hardware topology in account.
Motivated by the growing interest in qutrit-based quantum
computing, we develop analogous decomposition methods for
qutrit systems. Specifically, we introduce an algorithm
that decomposes the exponential of an arbitrary tensor
product of Weyl-Heisenberg operators (plus their Hermitian
conjugation) into single- and two-qutrit gates. We further
extend this approach to unitaries generated by Gell-Mann
string (i.e., a tensor product of Gell-Mann matrices).
Since both Gell-Mann matrices and Weyl-Heisenberg operators
form (together with identity) complete operator bases of
qutrit operators, we can use this result also to decompose
any multi-qutrit gate that is diagonal up to single-qutrit
    rotations.
        <br><br>
As a practical application, we use our method to decompose
the layers of the quantum approximate optimization
algorithm for qutrit-based implementations of the graph
k-coloring problem.
For values of k well-suited to qutrit architectures (e.g.,
k=3 or in general k=3^n), our approach yields significantly
shallower circuits compared to qubit-based implementations,
an advantage that grows with problem size, while also
requiring a smaller total Hilbert space dimension.
Finally, we also address the routing challenge in qutrit
architectures that arises due to the limited connectivity
of the devices. In particular, we generalize the
Steiner-Gauss method, originally developed to reduce CNOT
counts in qubit circuit, to optimize gate routing in
qutrit-based systems.

    Synthesis of Fault-tolerant State Preparation Circuits
using Steane-type Error Detection
  </span></br>
  <div class="abstract">
    <b>Abstract:</b>
    Fault-tolerant state preparation is essential for reliable
quantum error correction, particularly in Steane-type error
correction, which relies on robust ancilla states for
syndrome readout. One way of fault-tolerant state
preparation is to initialize multiple ancilla states and
check them against each other to detect problematic errors.
In the worst case, the number of states required for a
successful initialization grows polynomially with respect
to the distance of the code, but it has been shown that
this can be reduced to constant ancilla overhead—in the
best case, only four states are required. However, existing
techniques are limited to codes with large symmetric groups
like the Golay code. In this work, we propose a general,
automated synthesis methodology for Steane-type
fault-tolerant state preparation circuit synthesis that
applies to arbitrary Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) codes and
does not rely on symmetries in the code. We apply the
proposed methods to various CSS d = 5 and d = 7 codes and
demonstrate successful fault-tolerant initialization of
logical basis states under circuit-level depolarizing
noise. The circuits synthesized using the proposed
methodology provide an important step towards experimental
realizations of high-fidelity ancilla states for near-term
demonstration of fault-tolerant quantum computation.

    Efficient quantum circuits for solving classically
intractable optimization problems using Decoded Quantum
Interferometry
  </span></br>
  <div class="abstract">
    <b>Abstract:</b>
    Decoded Quantum Interferometry (DQI) is a quantum algorithm
for reducing classical optimization problems to classical
decoding problems by exploiting structure in the Fourier
spectrum of the objective function. When applied to the
Optimal Polynomial Intersection (OPI) problem, this
framework requires the decoding of Reed-Solomon codes. The
most computationally dominant part of the algorithm is
running a classical decoding algorithm as a reversible
quantum circuit, which is the main focus of our work.
    <br><br>
This work provides the first end-to-end resource estimates
for solving classically intractable instances of the OPI
problem using DQI. We introduce significant compilation
improvements, including adapting the problem to binary
extension fields to leverage optimized arithmetic and
developing a new, qubit-efficient compilation for the
Extended Euclidean Algorithm (EEA), which we belive will be
useful in cryptographic applications beyond DQI.
    <br><br>
Our analysis shows that an OPI instance, estimated to
require over 10²³ classical trials, can be solved with
approximately 1600 logical qubits and 33 million Toffoli
gates. These results provide a concrete roadmap and a
realistic assessment of the resources required to achieve
quantum advantage on a structured optimization problem.

    Compiling low-overhead circuits for error detection
  </span></br>
  <div class="abstract">
    <b>Abstract:</b>
    We introduce a low-overhead approach for detecting errors
in arbitrary Clifford circuits on arbitrary qubit
connectivities. Our method is based on the framework of
spacetime codes, and is particularly suited to near-term
hardware since it has a much milder overhead in qubits and
gates compared to error correction, while achieving a
better sampling overhead than existing error mitigation
methods. We present efficient algorithms for finding valid
checks that are simultaneously low weight, satisfy
connectivity constraints, and cover large detecting regions
within the circuit. Using this approach, we experimentally
demonstrate error detection on circuits of up to 50 logical
qubits containing 2450 CZ gates, and show physical to
logical fidelity gains of up to 236×. Furthermore, we show
our algorithm can efficiently find checks in universal
circuits, but the space of valid checks diminishes
exponentially with the non-Cliffordness of the circuit.
These theoretical and experimental results suggest that
Clifford-dominated circuits are promising candidates for
near-term quantum advantage.
